pandemonium is a very simple yet usable IRC client.
It is not trivial, but it is not overly complicated.
It will probably be GUI-y, too.
And hopefully cross-platform.


I'm going to rewrite this to become a flexible IRC bot, I think.
I have need of a bot, and no need of an IRC client.

It is probably wisest to simply kludge the hell out of it until it works.
Blocking mainloop, braindead message dispatch, lots of hard-coded stuff,
the works.  The server and channel might want to be taken from a command line.
